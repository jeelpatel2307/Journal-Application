# Journal Application

The Journal Application is a simple Python console-based application that allows users to keep track of their thoughts, experiences, or notes in a digital format. Users can add new entries, view existing entries, search for entries based on keywords, and delete entries.

## Project Structure

### 1. `journal_app.py`

- Contains the main code for the Journal Application.
- Defines the `JournalEntry` class to represent individual journal entries.
- Implements the `JournalApplication` class to manage the application, including adding, viewing, searching, and deleting entries.
- Provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface in the main function.

## How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `journal_app.py`.
2. Run the program using the command:
    
    ```bash
    python journal_app.py
    
    ```
    

## Usage

1. Choose options from the menu to add entries, view entries, search entries, delete entries, or exit the application.
2. Follow the prompts to input entry details, search for entries, or delete entries.
3. The system provides feedback on successful operations.

## Customization

Feel free to customize and expand upon this project based on your requirements. Possible enhancements include adding data persistence (saving entries to a file), implementing a graphical user interface (GUI), or introducing encryption for privacy.
